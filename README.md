## What I learnt

Data Engineering is a crucial phase in creating data bases, taking enough time designing an acurrate **ERD** will save us ton of time in building our queries to find the data we looking for, on queries sometimes the easiest approach is the right way to go, overthink stuff just takes us into a _rabbit hole_ adding frustration and stress.
