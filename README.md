# sql-challange

SQL homework corresponds to the 9th unit of the _Data Analisis bootcamp course_, on this assignment we were assign to analice six csv files corresponding to the employee records from a company, we have to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer next questions on the data we have:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

## What I learnt

Data Engineering is a crucial phase in creating data bases, taking enough time design and acurrate **ERD** will save us tons of time searching thru the data for the answears we want 

Besides IDEs, web notebooks provide and friendly and powerfull tool to develop scripting, on this challange we have the oportunity to interact with **Jupyter Notebook**, its live programming makes easer to find bugs on the scripting and the output interface give us rapid feedback of what we are doing and if we are on the right path. 

Pandas library helps data analisis trhu **Data Frame** building, once the data is in a data frame reshaping, data pivoting and data manipulation to get to the answers is really easy, the amount of methods and attributes that can be apply to Data Frames is huge, find different methods to get to the same point was another thing that I learnt in this challange.
